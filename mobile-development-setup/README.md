# Mobile Development Setup

Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the Expo Framework for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this task, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js LTS**
- **VS Code** (our recommended IDE)
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** (compatible operating system)
- **Expo Go** installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for completing the upcoming projects efficiently.

## Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

**Expo Go** provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.

## Steps to Install Expo Go

1. Visit the official Expo Go homepage: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)
2. Select the latest SDK version.
3. Click on **Install** for your device:
   - **Android:** Install from the Google Play Store.
   - **iOS:** Install from the Apple App Store.
4. Open the Expo Go app on your device.
5. Create a new account or log in if you already have one.

## Setup Process & Challenges

- The Expo Go app was not available in my country’s app store, so I had to change my region settings.
- My device could not connect to the local development server due to network/firewall restrictions.
- I encountered issues scanning the QR code; restarting both my phone and computer resolved it.
- The Expo Go app required an update before I could open my project.
- I had trouble logging in to Expo Go due to forgotten credentials and had to reset my password.
- The project failed to load on my device because my computer and phone were not on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Slow download speeds caused the Expo Go app to take
